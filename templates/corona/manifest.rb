  Corona based Aurora Subtheme.

  Please run `bundle install` from inside your new subtheme to isntall the required dependenecies. This will create a Gemfile.lock file, add this to your version control.

  When you are ready start compiling, run `bundle exec compass watch` instead of simply `compass watch` to ensure you are compiling using your dependent Compass extensions.
